The Online Attendance Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify
the tracking, management, and reporting of student attendance in real-time. Faculty members
can sign up, log in, mark attendance efficiently, view attendance records, and generate reports,
while students do not have login access. The system provides detailed reports and visualizes
attendance patterns through charts and graphs to help analyze trends. It also enables the
management of user accounts, classes, and student records, along with system settings such
as notifications. With a user-friendly interface accessible across devices, the system enhances
the efficiency of attendance tracking and management for educational institutions.
